     <h1>DIY Sensors</h1>
    In this session we were tought to build sensors with conductive and non-conductive materials. We used the arduino again as last week for connecting it with crocodilebrackets to our sensor. The sensor consists out of a black sponge wrapped by a piece of conductive fabric. This fabric has two outstanding ends in order to clamp the crocodilebrackets but these ends are not alowed to touch each other otherwise it would not work. The arduino is used to connect it with wires to a plate, paying attention to positive and negative ends. The LED-lamp is also been pluged in and conntected to the arduino. All these steps are also connected to the sensor. After activating the arduino program we press on the sensor and the program shows us values on the screen which change according to the contact.
