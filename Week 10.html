    <h1>Actuators and Sensors</h1>
    <p>
In this session we were working with different types of actuators and sensors.
The most important one for our final  project was the air motor that we will use to inflate that soft robotics part and control it using a MyoSensor and both are connected to the Arduino board. </p>
