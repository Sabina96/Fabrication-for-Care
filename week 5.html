    <h1>Week 5</h1>
    The body which is prepared in Fusion 360 is then inserted in Exact Flat to finalize it ,so that it is optimal for the laser cutter.
    After using Exact Flat the the prepared body is insrted to another program where the cutting way and process can be configured.
    Most important is to choose the right laser frequency according to the material and fabric whic is used. In order to deside about that several test are runned to see which is the most optimal frequency. After finishing the requirements for cutting the laser cutter has to be prepared. The material should be placed inside. The bar should be as needed moved forward or backward, then the distance of the laser is fixed by a needle which you have tomove up or down so that it touches the fabric but still stays straight and is not bowed. These actions can be adjusted by the manual on the the laser cutter itself which you can see on the first picture. Before turning on the machine it is very important to activate the vacuum so the lense is protected from damages.
