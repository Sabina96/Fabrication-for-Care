    <h1>Week 4</h1>
    <p>This week the usage of meshmixer is introduced to us and how to import the final model to Exact Flat in order to laser-print it. In this case a hand is been prepared and corrected for further process. It is been sculped with a ceratin brush to straighten neven fields and then wholes which are not scanned properly before.</p>

     <img src="meshmixer2.png" height="250";width="250";/>

    <p>When this is done the hand is transported to Fusion 360 where it is circled by a zylinder and extruded so it can be formed following the hand's shape. Which looks like this:</p>
     <img src="hand2.png" height="250";width="250";/>
     <p>Now it can be exported to Exact Flat program, cutted into several pieces which enables laser-printing.</p>
